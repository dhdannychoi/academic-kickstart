abstract = "​We examine how the expansion of mobile phone services--one of the most transformative innovations in communications infrastructure in recent history--affects national identity in sub-Saharan Africa. We argue that the effect of mobile coverage is heterogeneous across the types of service that citizens are able to access. While the bridging and cross-cutting potential of basic cellular service (2G coverage) functions to strengthen attachments to the nation, mobile internet service (3G coverage) exposes individuals to the divisive and polarizing influences of the internet, ultimately weakening national identity. We use a combination of geocoded public opinion surveys of more than 75,000 citizens across Africa and fine-grained mobile phone coverage maps to test these claims. Applying both a difference-in-difference strategy and a geographic boundary design, we show that access to 2G coverage 
**increases** the probability that an individual identifies with the nation of around 3--4 percentage points. Yet we observe the opposite effect for 3G services; access **decreases** the propensity to identify with the nation by up to 8--9 percentage points. To establish support for our mechanism, we exploit as-if random variation in the timing of individuals' survey interviews to presidential election campaigns, during which we argue divisive and polarizing forces are at their peak. Our analysis suggests that while electoral proximity does not alter the relationship between 2G coverage and national identification, it does intensify the negative effect of 3G coverage."
