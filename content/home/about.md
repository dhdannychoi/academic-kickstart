I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Identity and Conflict Lab (ICL) at the University of Pennsylvania. Starting Fall 2019, I will be starting as an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh.

In my book project, *Severed Connections: Political Parties and Democratic Representation in Africa*, I investigate how political parties and the nature of candidate selection institutions influence the relationship between elected representatives and their constituents.

â€‹My research has been supported by the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS), the Institute for International Studies (IIS), Center for African Studies (CAS), and the Peder Sather Center for Advanced Study at UC Berkeley,  and the Research Council of Norway (RCN).
