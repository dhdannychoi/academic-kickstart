# 

Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I received my Ph.D. in political science from UC Berkeley and was a pre/postdoctoral fellow in the Identity and Conflict Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. 

My research focuses on two broad themes: democratic representation and identity politics. My first book project, **Severed Connections: Intraparty Politics and Representation in Democratic Africa**, investigates how political parties and the nature of candidate selection institutions influence the relationship between elected representatives and their constituents in new democracies. My second book project, **Norms, Social Identities, and Immigrant Inclusion in Democratic Societies**, examines the extent to which common norms, identities, and ideas can reduce prejudice and discrimination against immigrant minorities and ultimately facilitate their inclusion and integration in democratic societies. In addition to these two book projects, I also have a series of working papers and projects in progress on these two themes.


My research has been supported by the Institute for International Studies (IIS), Center for African Studies (CAS), and the Peder Sather Center for Advanced Study at UC Berkeley, the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS), and the Research Council of Norway (RCN). My work has appeared in _Political Analysis_ and _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_.
