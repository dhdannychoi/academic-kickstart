# 

Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Pittsburgh. I received my Ph.D. in political science from UC Berkeley and was a pre/postdoctoral fellow in the Identity and Conflict Lab at the University of Pennsylvania.

My research focuses on democratic representation, political behavior, and identity politics in the developing world and beyond. My book project, **_Severed Connections: Intraparty Politics and Representation in Democratic Africa_**, investigates how political parties and the nature of candidate selection institutions influence the relationship between elected representatives and their constituents in new democracies. 

​My research has been supported by the Institute for International Studies (IIS), Center for African Studies (CAS), and the Peder Sather Center for Advanced Study at UC Berkeley, the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS), and the Research Council of Norway (RCN). My work has appeared in or is forthcoming at _Political Analysis_ and _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_.
